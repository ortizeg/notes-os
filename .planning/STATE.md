# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-07)

**Core value:** A person can triage their Apple Notes inbox into PARA folders with single keystrokes — fast, mouse-free, and non-destructive — with the Notes database backed up before every write.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Scaffold

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 6 phases derived from PRD branch order and dependency chain
- Roadmap: Phase 4 bundles Config + Router + UI + Session (17 reqs) — tightly coupled, single delivery boundary: working sort flow
- Roadmap: Backup (Phase 3) placed immediately after Bridge (Phase 2) — write-path safety before any router move is exercised
- Roadmap: TUI integration (Phase 6) is last — depends on all other modules

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- AppleScript bridge (Phase 2) is the critical-path dependency for all write operations; integration tests require macOS and real Apple Notes — CI must be macOS-only
- Write-path modules (notes.py, backup.py, router.py) carry a 95% coverage floor — test-first discipline required in Phases 2, 3, 4
